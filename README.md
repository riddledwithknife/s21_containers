# s21_containers

Implementation of the s21_containers.h. library.

### Part 1. Implementation of the s21_containers.h library

You need to implement the `s21_containers.h` library classes (specifications are given in the relevant material sections, see **"Main containers"**). \
List of classes: `list`, `map`, `queue`, `set`, `stack`, `vector`.
- Make it as a header file `s21_containers.h` which includes different header files with implementations of the specified containers (`s21_list.h`, `s21_map.h` and etc.) 
- Provide a Makefile for testing the library (with targets clean, test)
- The classical implementation of containers should be considered as a basis, but the final choice of implementations remains free. Except for the list - it should be implemented via the list structure rather than the array
